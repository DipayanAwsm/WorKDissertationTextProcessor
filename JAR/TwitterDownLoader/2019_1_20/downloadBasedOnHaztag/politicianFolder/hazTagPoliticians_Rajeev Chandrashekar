Time the party leadership told Rajeev Chandrashekar to choose between membership of the party or his investments in Asianet and other brazenly anti Hindi anti BJP media entities like Asianet. This has been going on for far too long. @psspillaibjp @Kummanam @surendranbjp @AmitShah https://t.co/j08m7kAD5u
@waglenikhil When rajeev chandrashekar promoted republic, you were making so much noise. Now is it ok if sibal being promoter for this channel?
A channel is need of the hour.
Bjp has many 'official party channel
And 'unofficial party channel which become 'official' in crucial time. 

I am sure kapil sibal wouldn't be like Rajeev chandrashekar.
He would give more freedom to channel

@rupasubramanya @divyaspandana @RahulGandhi @rajeev_mp it is rich coming from rajeev chandrashekar who ate his own father in laws money and scooted and now giving sermons on patriotism,for any information can ask his brother in law who is a gem of a guy
@republic can rajeev chandrashekar and his coterie of pliable lap dogs ever do proper journalism?
@AdityaMenon22 @MyNation Kyunki Rahul Shivshankar Times Now mein hai. MyNation ka baap (Rajeev Chandrashekar) Republic TV se juda hua hai. Either ways, the mosquito menace has to be eradicated in India...!!!

@sanjukta Madam, he is the editor of MyNation which is part of Asianet News Network (owned by Rajya Sabha BJP MP Rajeev Chandrashekar) The MP has his investments in Republic TV, too. You see the connection? Manufactured/fake news creators, BJP IT cell??
@NATRAJSHETTY @Swamy39 You know @Swamy39 claimed that Rajeev Gandhi offer him PM post instead of Chandrashekar
