@Phoenixfirefive @0K_ultra @K_Niemietz I’m unaware of any tankies that actually support any of that. Maybe the arrests of Trotskyists because they don’t like Trotskyists. But that’s neither here nor there. Different historical conditions produce different revolutions, Stalin isn’t going to get out of his grave.

Why M.K.Stalin didn't back Rahul Gandhi as PM in WB?, because there were half a dozen PM aspirants at the Dias. He wanted to avoid getting into the bad books of those leaders
