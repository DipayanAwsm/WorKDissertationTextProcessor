@soplimpsest Tough fight but Poonam Mahajan is the front runner. That Priya Dutt is not contesting helps her. Check my post on the fight in Mumbai North Central

Today's LS constituency I will update you on is Mumbai North Central 

I have my hopes pinned on this one ....We can win this seat

After Priya Dutt's exit from politics , Nagma Morarji is expected to get ticket from INC. Poonam Mahajan is the winning candidate from 2014

Despite all the arguments Priya Ramani makes in this piece, Barkha is neither powerful nor independent, and Radia tapes are not just a chink in her armour, and male journalsts have not moved past the story.

@Khaana_Lao SD had lots of difficulty in getting bail on TADA. All the running around was done by Sunil Dutt and his sisters especially Priya Dutt. His second wife Rhea supported him during the ordeal. His first wife has passed away by then I think. But he had given her a tough time 1/n
