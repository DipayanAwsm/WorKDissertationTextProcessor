@SirPareshRawal @narendramodi It is very much disappointing to see Paresh Rawal, an actor, has not given due to the best acting skills by himself, @vickykaushal09, & flawless direction by @AdityaDharFilms! Instead the Politician in him choose to do the best he can do for Modi, chaaplusy!

In URI movie, actually Paresh Rawal should have played PM Modi....See how brilliantly he played role of Sunil Dutt in Sanju.
@dhruv_rathee It's election time and he is using film stars popularity n fan base for his campaignng otherwise till now he met only paresh rawal n anupam kher only
URI is a great movie, every Indian should watch. We. all should know what is happening ??
Vicky Kaushal n Paresh Rawal were too good.
Proper justice was not done by the actor who played PM Modi 's character. His voice was not roaring voice of Modi

When bringing the drone back, though, Ishaan tells Paresh Rawal that the drone can hover for take off and landing. "So then why did you make Brian run?" Paresh Rawal asks. Ishaan shrugs, and the subject is dropped.
Ishaan is an intern who has managed to cobble together an eagle-like drone with all the required specs. What is it called? Garud, after the Vishnu Puran, says Ishaan. But does it work? We cut to outside in a field where Ishaan, Brian and Paresh Rawal are standing.
Anyway, the Israeli drone is not up to par! Paresh Rawal despairs! Brian can't do anything in the limited time before the strike! But all is not lost. As they are walking out, Paresh Rawal sees a young man playing with what looks like a toy eagle. This character's name is ISHAAN.
The Ajit Doval stand-in, played by Paresh Rawal, has gone to inspect the research division to see what drones are available to assist in reconnaissance. The head of the division proudly shows off a drone built with Israeli assistance. This character's name? BRIAN.
