Amin Patel & Milind Deora,chief guests at the inauguration of a new door at a Dargah (Dongri) last week,got booed by the crowd till they left!

Why?

Congress didn't gave much ears to request for excessive use of road for the festival.

All approvals came from Arvind Sawant!

@c_aashish BJP has a good chance to win all four seats if Sena fight separately. Of the other two, Sena and Cong are front runners on Mumbai South Central. BJP has to fight a strong challenge from Milind Deora in Mumbai South. BJP can maxout at 5/6 in Mumbai
@RahulGandhi Sam Pitroda and Milind Deora should be given all the credit.
Not one to score political points on  some1’s passing away, bt what’s with @ndtv saying she contested unsuccessfully against Milind Deora - not once, bt twice in this article. SS won by more than a lac votes,followed by INc, MNS and AAP & Dey say as if it was INC 1st and AAP 2nd https://t.co/0gBvmQkGEF
